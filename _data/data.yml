career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |  
      I am currently double majoring in the School of Computing and the School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST.

      My research and experience have focused on large language models and automatic speech recognition, with topics broadly divided into (1) AI-driven education and (2) AI fairness.
      While working at Ringle, an English-speaking education startup, I spearheaded the planning and development of an AI-driven engine that predicts IELTS/TOEFL speaking scores by analyzing conversations between tutors and learners. 
      Recognizing the low performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the second language learners, I was dispatched to KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB) as a visiting researcher affiliated with Ringle to conduct related research.
      I constructed a dataset of non-native English learners’ spontaneous speech and analyzed the reasons behind the low ASR performance for the second language learners. The paper about the research is currently under review for {anonymized}.
      Furthermore, I conducted a course work project proposing a new evaluation benchmark task by attempting to measure the correlation between the knowledge level of large language models and fairness. 
      I have also worked on projects such as generating 3D mesh from Single-View Multi-object images, winning the best poster awards, and utilizing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
      
      Currently, I am interested in delving more mathematically into the field of artificial intelligence, especially minority group data augmentation and convex optimization. Therefore, I am taking courses such as <EE326: Introduction to Information Theory and Coding> and <EE531: Statistical Learning Theory>.

          While working at Ringle, an English-speaking education startup, I spearheaded the planning and development of an AI-driven engine, named <a href="https://www.ringleplus.com/ko/student/landing/blog/caf-analysis-about" target="_blank">CAF</a>, that predicts IELTS/TOEFL speaking scores by analyzing conversations between tutors and learners.
            - Defined features related to the English proficiency of learners.
            - Conducted analysis on both spoken and written language.
            - Analyzed the performance of ASR for non-native English learners.
            - Developed sentence structure classification algorithms through part-of-speech (POS) and dependency analysis.
            - Collected ground truth data for IELTS speaking levels and addressed data imbalance issues through data augmentation.
            - Conducted feature engineering based on the defined features.
            - Developed a final prediction model by using the augmented data and the extracted features.

        company: <a href="https://www.kixlab.org/" target="_blank">KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB), Daejeon</a>
        details: |
          Recognizing the low performance of ASR for second language (L2) learners, I was dispatched to KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB) as a visiting researcher affiliated with Ringle.
          I have published a paper about ASR for L2 spontaneous speech as the first author. It is currently under review for {anonymized}.
          Additionally, I filed two patents under the names &lt;L2 Speaker Annotation System&gt; and &lt;Pronunciation Diagnosis and Learning System&gt;.
            - Constructed a dataset consisting of 50.04 hours of audio with fully transcribed transcriptions.
            - Defined new features attributed to ASR errors from L2 speech through linguistic analysis of transcriptions.
            - Constructed human annotation experiment to measure newly defined features.
            - Developed the automatic detection system to detect the features.
            - Improved the performance of state-of-the-art models by fine-tuning with the constructed dataset.
            - Attempted to synthesize non-native speaker-like audio that can mimic the defined features.

        tagline: "&lt;CS479: Machine Learning for 3D Data&gt; (Best Poster Awards)"  
        details: |
          We addressed the existing issue of synthesizing meshes from single-view images containing multiple objects. 
          We inferred the relative distances between objects using depth maps image segmentation and stable diffusion inpainting, and based on this, we chose an approach to reassemble each synthesized mesh in a 3D scene.

          The project proposes a new benchmark task for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by demonstrating the correlation between the level of knowledge in LLMs and the degree of bias. 
          We utilize the concept of markedness and statistical methods, Finghtin' Words method, to measure it.
